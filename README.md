Free, interactive Python course for everyone — from complete beginners to
working professionals. A **hybrid** course by design: it teaches real
Python fundamentals the traditional way (write it yourself, understand
why it works, get it wrong and fix it) and, starting with Chapter 25,
pairs that with genuine AI-collaboration practice — the reasoning behind
each worked example, writing the prompt you'd give an AI assistant to
build it, and an "AI-paired" version of every project with real, subtle
bugs planted in it to practice catching. Neither half substitutes for
the other; see [Chapter 25](chapters/chapter-25-memory-management/lesson.html)
for the reference implementation of that standard.

All 33 chapters are complete, along with 4 written module exams and 4
capstone reference implementations under [`capstones/`](capstones).

## What this is

A self-paced Python course built as a series of small, interactive HTML
"mini textbooks" — no sign-up, no cost, no assumed background. Every chapter
follows the same format:

1. A real-world hook before any syntax
2. Each sub-topic explained in plain language, with its own "What is...?"
   callouts, annotated code (plus a live in-browser "Run Code" playground
   where the example doesn't need `input()`), an optional "Go Deeper" box,
   and a short Quick Recap
3. **(Chapter 25 onward)** A GenAI thought-process + prompt box after every
   worked example — the reasoning an experienced developer works through
   before writing the code, a space to write your own prompt, and a real
   reference prompt to compare against. There's no scored "AI grader" —
   an earlier heuristic version was retired after it scored the course's
   own reference prompts below perfect; the honest version just points
   you at a real assistant to test your own prompt against.
4. A full Points to Remember summary at the end
5. An interactive fill-in-the-blank quiz — each blank has its own **Check**
   button for instant ✅/❌ feedback, a live progress bar, no backend,
   nothing leaves your browser
6. Exercises, including at least one "Debug the Code" task
7. A Practice Bank — a deeper, per-topic problem set (5-10 problems per
   sub-topic) with at least two scenario-based, interview-style problems
   per topic, for extra reps and interview prep
8. Interview questions (strong answer / red flags / follow-up format) plus
   a rapid-fire recall quiz
9. A small real, resume-worthy project that uses everything the chapter
   taught
10. **(Chapter 25 onward)** An "AI-paired" follow-up to the project — a
    realistic AI-generated solution with 1-3 genuinely subtle bugs planted
    in it, then a reveal walking through what the AI's code actually got
    wrong. The point is practicing code review and skepticism toward AI
    output, not just prompting it.

Every 4-6 chapters form a **module**, capped with a written exam covering
everything in that module. Completing a chapter's quiz with a perfect
score marks it "✓ Completed" sitewide (stored only in your browser's
local storage — no accounts, no tracking).

## Status

The course is complete: all 33 chapters, spanning Modules 1-6
(Foundations through Interview & Career Prep), plus 4 written module
exams and 4 capstone reference implementations, are built and live.
The GenAI thought-process/prompt-box and AI-paired-critique standard is
new as of Chapter 25 — it's the direction every chapter from Chapter 25
onward is built with. A retrofit pass to add it to Chapters 1-24 is
planned but not yet started, so don't expect it on earlier chapters yet.

See the live [roadmap page](https://technaom.github.io/python-for-everyone/docs/curriculum/index.html)
(or the plain-text draft at
[`docs/curriculum/CURRICULUM_MAP.md`](docs/curriculum/CURRICULUM_MAP.md))
for the full 33-chapter roadmap.

Every chapter page is fully cross-linked: lesson → quiz → exercises →
interview questions → project → back to all chapters, plus a top-nav
Roadmap link on every page. The left chapter panel automatically expands
only the current chapter's subtopics and its module, keeping that chapter
in view when navigating between pages or using browser Back/Forward.

## Running the Python exercises locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechNaom/python-for-everyone.git
cd python-for-everyone
python3 --version   # confirm Python 3 is installed — no other dependencies needed
```

Each chapter's `exercises/` and `project/` folders are plain, dependency-free
Python scripts — just `python3 <file>.py`. The lesson pages and quizzes need
no installation at all; open them directly in a browser or read them via the
live Pages site above.
